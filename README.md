# Advent of Code 2024

Solutions for Advent of Code 2024, written in Rust of course :3 🦀

This is also a way for me to try out the new edition 2024 nightly.

*Yes* I *do* know that it's over-engineered, *no* I will *not* change it, and *yes* that's both an unsafe block and a semi-complex macro in `main`.
I love my `main.rs`, it brings me joy.

## Usage

First, make sure you put your input data in the `data/` directory using the format '`data/day_#.txt`'.

This program can then be run using the following commands:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Jaxydog/advent-of-code-2024.git
cd advent-of-code-2024/

# Compile and run the executable
# Usage: cargo run -- <day #> <solution #> <use example data? (0 or 1)>
cargo run --release -- 1 1 0
```

Alternatively, you can think *really hard* while looking at your input file and it will probably be just as efficient.
